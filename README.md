#### About Vinta
> The project is a video streaming website inspired by Disney+. The website is called Vinta, which is a streaming platform for videos such as but not limited to Philippine movies, TV Series, and documentaries. The name Vinta comes from the similar word vinta which is a native/traditional watercraft from the Philippines. It is used to travel and transport above water from island to island.
> Vinta in this case is used as it is intended used which is to transport/travel above water.
> River or sea (which are composed of water) in this case are collection or body of memories as well as a wide range of emotions which is inspired by the concept of "water memory" from French scientist Jacques Benveniste in 1988 (which is also the basis for the plot from the movie Frozen 2).
> Hence, Vinta/Banca is a streaming platform that takes you to different journeys even the past nostalgic shows you formerly enjoy.
